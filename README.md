# PlateTectonicTools

Python tools for plate tectonic research.

This repository contains the Python package **ptt** (short for Plate Tectonic Tools) which provides a collection of common plate tectonic functionality that researchers can use in their workflows. It is primarily built on top of the [pyGPlates](http://gplates.org/docs/pygplates/index.html) Python library.

There are also some Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate usage of the **ptt** package:

* Calculating average seafloor spreading rates of mid-ocean ridges
* Calculating subducting rate of paleo rasters along subduction zones
* Predicting CO2 from age and bottom water temperature.

*Note:* This repository is only in its initial stages. More functionality and examples will be provided in future.
