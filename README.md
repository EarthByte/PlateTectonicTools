# PlateTectonicTools
Python tools for plate tectonic research.

A collection of Python code to access plate tectonic functionality (primarily built on top of the existing [pyGPlates](http://gplates.org/docs/pygplates/index.html) library).

Currently there are a couple of Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate:

* Calculating average seafloor spreading rates of mid-ocean ridges
* Calculating subducting rate of paleo rasters at each age by sampling reconstructed rasters along subduction zones
